This is a GitHub repository based on [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)), converting my Lab fMRI tutorial material to the static website (https://mri.msense.de).  

Some useful actions for updating website:

## Building Quartz

```bash
npx quartz build --serve

```
Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to view it. 

## Commit Changes

```bash
npx quartz sync

```

Sometime additional sync can be done via VS Code git plugin.
