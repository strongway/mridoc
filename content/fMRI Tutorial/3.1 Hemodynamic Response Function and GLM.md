## Hemodynamic response function [^1]

The most widely used fMRI analysis is the general linear model (GLM) capitalizes on the changes in blood flow and oxygenation associated with neural activity (the hemodynamic response), and on the differing magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. 

When a person performs a specific task or experiences a particular sensation, the brain's blood flow increases in the regions that are associated with that activity. This increase in blood flow is known as the hemodynamic response.

Suppose we present a stimulus event $E_i$ to a participant at time 0. Let $N_i(t)$ denote the neural activation induced by this event at time $t$ and let $B_i(t)$ denote the correspond BOLD response. So we have the following mapping:

$$N_i(t) \rightarrow f(\cdot) \rightarrow B_i(t)$$

A system of this type mapping is called linear _if and only if_ it satisfies the __superposition principle__:

if $f[N_1(t)] = B_1(t)$ and $f[N_2(t)] = B_2(t)$, then it must be true that

$$f[a_1N_1(t)+a_2N_2(t)] = a_1B_1(t)+a_2B_2(t)$$

If the superposition principle holds, then there is a straightforward way to determine the BOLD response to any neural activation from teh results of one simple experiment. Let's consider a delta function $\delta(t - \tau) = 1   \text{ if } t= \tau; \text{ otherwise }=0$,


Suppose we have the following neural activity function after discretize. We can rewrite the function as 

$$
N(t) = n_1\delta(t-1) + n_2\delta(t-2) + ... + n_9\delta(t-9)
$$


More general form will be:

$$N(t) = \sum_{\tau = 0}^\infty n_\tau \delta (t-\tau)$$


The above is a convolution operation. 


With the superposition principle, we can decompose the BOLD response:

$$B(t) =f[N(t)] =f[\sum_{\tau = 0}^\infty n_\tau \delta (t-\tau)] = \sum_{\tau = 0}^t n_\tau h(t-\tau)$$

Here $h(t-\tau)$ is the response of the system to the delta function, traditionally called the _impulse response function_. In the fMRI literature, however, $h(t)$ is known as the hemodynamic response function (HRF). 

The hemodynamic response function __is not__ a synonym for the BOLD response. Rather, it is the _hypothetical_ BOLD response to an idealized impulse of neural activation. 

If we let successive values $\tau$  small enough, we get an integral from the above equation:
$$
B(t) = \int_0^t N(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau
$$
This is known as _convolution integral_, and often written as $B(t) = N(t) \star h(t)$. 

### What does a hemodynamic response function look like?

Richter & Richter (2003) used a flashing checker board image for 500 ms and recorded the BOLD response in area V1 for three different groups. The HRFs look like:

### Candidates for HRF

#### 1. Gamma function

The Gmma function makes a good proximation, but no negative dip. 

#### 2. A difference of two gamma functions
One for early peak, and one for the late dip. 

#### 3. a weighted linear combination of basis function

$$h(t) = \theta_1 b_1(t) + \theta_2 b_2(t) + \theta_3 b_3(t) $$
where $b_i(t) = a\cdot t^b \cdot e^{-t}$. 

### Canonical HRF functions 

Three canonical hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) are commonly used: Gamma, Gamma-variate, and Double-Gamma functions.

The Gamma functions are the most commonly used HRFs in AFNI. They consist of a single gamma function, which describes the shape of the hemodynamic response. The Gamma functions are parameterized by the peak response time, the undershoot time, and the ratio of the peak response to the undershoot.

Gamma functions:

$$g(t) = \frac{t^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\frac{t}{\beta}}}{\beta^{\alpha} \Gamma(\alpha)}$$

Here, $t$ represents time, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the shape and scale parameters of the gamma function, $\Gamma$ is the gamma function

The Gamma-variate functions are similar to the Gamma functions, but they consist of a combination of two gamma functions. The first gamma function describes the shape of the initial peak response, and the second gamma function describes the shape of the undershoot. The Gamma-variate functions are parameterized by the peak response time, the undershoot time, the peak-undershoot ratio, and the relative amplitude of the second gamma function.

Gamma-variate functions:


$$g(t) = \frac{t^{\alpha_1 - 1} e^{-\frac{t}{\beta_1}}}{\beta_1^{\alpha_1} \Gamma(\alpha_1)} + \frac{a_2 \cdot t^{\alpha_2 - 1} e^{-\frac{t}{\beta_2}}}{\beta_2^{\alpha_2} \Gamma(\alpha_2)}$$


where $a_2$ is the relative amplitude of the second gamma function. 

The Double-Gamma functions are also similar to the Gamma functions, but they consist of two gamma functions that are convolved together. The Double-Gamma functions are parameterized by the peak response time, the undershoot time, the peak-undershoot ratio, and the relative amplitude and time delay of the second gamma function.

Double-Gamma functions:


$$g(t) = \frac{t^{\alpha_1 - 1} e^{-\frac{t}{\beta_1}}}{\beta_1^{\alpha_1} \Gamma(\alpha_1)} \otimes \frac{a_2 \cdot t^{\alpha_2 - 1} e^{-\frac{t}{\beta_2}}}{\beta_2^{\alpha_2} \Gamma(\alpha_2)}$$

$\otimes$ denotes convolution. In the Gamma-variate and Double-Gamma functions, the parameters $\alpha_1$, $\beta_1$, $\alpha_2$, and $\beta_2$ are the shape and scale parameters of the two gamma functions, respectively.

In general, the choice of which HRF to use in AFNI depends on the specific research question and the data being analyzed. The Gamma functions are a good starting point for most applications, but the other HRFs may be more appropriate for certain types of data or research questions.

## General linear model

$$Y = \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X3 + \epsilon $$

where $beta$ is berta weights, $X$ regressor, $\epsilon$ residual. 

In fMRI analysis, we estimate the average amplitude of the BOLD signal in response to each condition in our model. 

Since every voxel has its own time-series, we do the procedure above for every voxel in the brain. This is known as a __mass univariate__ analysis, since we estimate beta weights for each voxel's time-series.
