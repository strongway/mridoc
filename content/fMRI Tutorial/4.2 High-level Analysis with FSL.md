High-level analysis in FSL aggregates results from individual subjects to draw inferences about a population. The typical steps involve:

- **Data collection:** Gather first-level FEAT outputs (cope, varcope, and sometimes t-statistic images).
- **Design specification**: Define your design matrix and contrast vectors to model group-level effects.
- **Estimation:** Use FSLâ€™s FEAT (or FLAME) for mixed-effects analysis.
- **Inference:** Correct for multiple comparisons and interpret cluster or voxel-level results.

## 1. Prepare your first-level data

After the first-level analysis, you have the necessary data organized. For example, you put all subject-wise data in subfolder `derivatives`:

## 2. Create Design and Contrast Matrix 

Open `Feat &` GUI, and add all first-level feat folders or COPE files, depending on your experimental design. 

[Andy Jahn's brain book website](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides excellent instructions on this. Please check his [second-level analysis](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fMRI_Short_Course/fMRI_07_2ndLevelAnalysis.html) and [third-level analysis](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fMRI_Short_Course/fMRI_08_3rdLevelAnalysis.html) for details.

Essentially, you need to create a higher-level analysis by setting up a new FEAT design file. Here is an example of such design file: 

```bash
# Higher-level FEAT design example for one-sample t-test

# Set the basic parameters
set fmri(npts) 1
set fmri(outputdir) "group_level.feat"

# Input subject-level cope images
set feat_files(1) "/path/to/sub01/first_level.feat/stats/cope1.nii.gz"
set feat_files(2) "/path/to/sub02/first_level.feat/stats/cope1.nii.gz"
set feat_files(3) "/path/to/sub03/first_level.feat/stats/cope1.nii.gz"
# ... add more subjects as needed

# Define the design matrix file paths
set fmri(groupfile) "feat_dir_list.txt"
set fmri(cope1) 1

# Set up the design for a one-sample t-test
set fmri(contrasts) "1"
set fmri(contrast_names1) "Mean Effect"

# Use FLAME stage 1 (or stage 1+2 for more accurate variance estimation)
set fmri(flame_level) 2
```

The above example uses the FLAME method (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects). 

## 3. Inspecting and Interpreting Results

After running your higher-level analysis, you should review:

- **Statistical maps:** (e.g., zstat images) to identify significant clusters.
- **Cluster reports:** Check the clusters in the FEAT report.
- Overlay images: Use FSLview or FSLeyes to overlay significant clusters on anatomical images.
